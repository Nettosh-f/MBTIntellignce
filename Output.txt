Your Myers-Briggs® Step II™ Interpretive Report is an in-depth, 
personalized description of your personality preferences, 
derived from your answers to the MBTI® assessment. It 
includes your Step I™ results and your four-letter type, along 
with your Step II results, which show some of the unique ways 
you express your Step I type.
The MBTI assessment was developed by Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs as 
an application of Carl Jung’s theory of personality types. This theory suggests 
that we have opposite ways of directing and receiving energy (Extraversion or 
Introversion), taking in information (Sensing or Intuition), deciding or coming 
to conclusions about that information (Thinking or Feeling), and approaching 
the outside world (Judging or Perceiving). 
Everyone can and does use each of these eight parts of personality at least 
some of the time but prefers one in each pair over the other, just as most 
people have a natural preference for using one hand rather than the other.  
No preference in a pair is better or more desirable than its opposite.
The MBTI assessment does not measure your skills or abilities in any area. 
Rather, it is a tool to help you become aware of your particular style and to 
better understand and appreciate the helpful ways that people differ from  
one another. 
Extraversion
You focus on the outside 
world and get energy through 
interacting with people  
and/or doing things.Introversion
You focus on the inner world 
and get energy through 
reflecting on information, 
ideas, and/or concepts.
Sensing
You notice and trust facts, 
details, and present realities.Intuition
You attend to and trust 
interrelationships, theories, and 
future possibilities.
Thinking
You make decisions using 
logical analysis to  
achieve objectivity.Feeling
You make decisions using 
person-centered values to 
achieve harmony.
Judging
You tend to be organized  
and orderly and to make 
decisions quickly.Perceiving
You tend to be flexible and 
adaptable and to keep your 
options open as long as 
possible.

ESTJ |3
ESTJs are typically logical, analytical, and objectively critical. They like to organize projects and then act to get things 
done in a systematic, timely, and efficient manner. ESTJs focus on seeing things as they are, not as they might be. They 
are matter-of-fact, practical, realistic, and concerned with the here and now. Past experience helps them solve problems, 
and they want to be sure that ideas, plans, and decisions are based on solid fact.
They like having definite rules to govern the way they do things. If they are to change their way of doing something, 
they need to change their rules for doing it. Logical and consistent, ESTJs make quick decisions. Their focus is on the 
immediate, visible, and tangible. They like to solve problems and organize things and then move on. They have little 
patience for confusion or inefficiency and may proceed—sometimes with a heavy hand—to help the groups they are part 
of get the task done. 
ESTJs are likely to be most satisfied in a work environment that values setting goals, making decisions, being organized, 
and getting things done. People can count on them to follow through in an organized, efficient, and practical manner.Your Step I™ Results  
The paragraphs below and the graph that follows them 
provide information about the personality type you reported. 
Each of the four preferences you indicated is shown by a line

Your Step II™ Facet Results  
The MBTI Step II assessment indicates some of the complexity of your 
personality by showing your results on five different parts, or facets,  for each 
of the Step I preference pairs, as shown on the left. Knowing your results 
on these 20 facets can help you better understand your unique way of 
experiencing and expressing your type.  
Facts About the Facets
• The five facets within a preference do not cover or explain the full 
meaning of the preference.
• Each facet has a theme, such as “Ways to connect with others.”
• Each facet has two opposite poles (e.g., Initiating and Receiving). 
• The facets are scored differently than are the preferences, and so your 
five facet scores don’t add up to your Step I preference score. 
How to Read Your Step II™ Results
The next few pages show graphs of your facet results. Each graph includes
• Brief descriptions of two opposite MBTI Step I preferences.
• The names of the five facet poles associated with each Step I preference 
and three descriptive words or phrases for each pole.
• A line indicating your score. The length of the line shows how clearly you 
scored toward that pole. 
 –You are more likely to favor the pole on the same side as your Step I 
preference, an in-preference  result, represented by a score of 2–5 on a 
blue background. Thus you are more likely to favor the Initiating pole if you 
prefer Extraversion and the Receiving pole if you prefer Introversion.
 –Or you might favor a pole that is opposite to your Step I preference, an out-
of-preference  result, represented by a score of 2–5 on the opposite side on 
a dark green background.
 –Or you might show no clear preference for either pole, a midzone  result, 
represented by a score of 0 or 1 on either side on a light green background.
Below each graph is a chart describing your facet results. The left column lists 
the facet theme (e.g., “Ways to connect with others”), your facet result, and 
its category (in-preference, out-of-preference, or midzone). The middle and 
right columns list ways people with your facet results are typically described. 
If a set of statements in the chart doesn’t seem to fit, perhaps you would 
be better described by the opposite pole or the midzone. To understand an 
opposite facet pole, read the short descriptors for each in the graph above.

Applying Step II™ Results to Communicating
All aspects of your type influence how you communicate, especially as part of a team. Nine of the facets are particularly 
relevant to communication. Your preferences for these nine facets along with tips for better communication appear 
below.
In addition to the tips in the table, keep in mind that communication for every type includes
• Telling others what kind of information you need.
• Asking others what they need.
• Monitoring your impatience when other styles dominate.
• Realizing that others likely are not trying to annoy you when they use their own communication styles. 
YOUR FACET RESULT COMMUNICATION STYLE ENHANCING YOUR STYLE
Initiating Start interactions by helping people get to 
know one another.Make sure that people actually need and want 
these introductions.
Expressive Say whatever is on your mind to anyone who 
will listen.Recognize when it’s important not  to say 
what’s on your mind and then don’t say it.
Active Like to communicate and interact with others 
face-to-face.Recognize when face-to-face communication 
may be intrusive or unnecessary.
Enthusiastic Readily show enthusiasm for the subject  
at hand.Be careful not to overwhelm and override 
others; make sure you ask for input.
Concrete Talk about the here-and-now detail. Be open to the inferences that can arise from 
the details.
Accommodating Seek to ensure harmony by being agreeable. Be aware that people may think you have no 
real opinions or that you’re hiding your real 
views; let them know what you care about.
Critical Naturally take a critiquing stance to just about 
everything.Recognize that others may mistake your 
critiquing for personal criticism and be clear 
when this isn’t your intent.
Tough Embody the phrase “Let’s get on with it!” Be aware that sometimes your way of moving 
ahead may be wrong for the situation.
Methodical Identify the steps and their order before 
starting a task.Be tolerant of others who plunge in without 
identifying steps.

Applying Step II™ Results to Making Decisions
Effective decision making requires gathering information from a variety of perspectives and applying sound methods 
of evaluating that information. Knowledge of the Step II facets gives us specific ways to enhance our decision making, 
especially those facets related to Sensing, Intuition, Thinking, and Feeling. Below are general questions associated with 
those facets. The facet poles you prefer are in blue italics.  If you are in the midzone, neither pole is highlighted.
         SENSING          INTUITION
Concrete: 
 What do we know? How do we know it? Abstract: What else could this mean?
Realistic: 
 What are the real costs? Imaginative: What else can we come up with?
Practical:  
 Will it work? Conceptual: What other interesting ideas are there?
Experiential: 
 Can you show me how it works? Theoretical: How is it all interconnected?
Traditional:  
 Does anything really need changing? Original: What’s a new way to do this?
         THINKING          FEELING
Logical: 
 What are the pros and cons? Empathetic: What do we like and dislike? 
Reasonable: 
 What are the logical consequences? Compassionate: What impact will this have on people? 
Questioning:  
 But what about…? Accommodating: How can we make everyone happy? 
Critical: 
 What’s wrong with this? Accepting:  What’s beneficial in this? 
Tough: Why aren’t we following through now? Tender: What about the people who will be hurt?
Six different ways of evaluating information, called decision-making styles, have been identified based on two facets of 
the Thinking–Feeling preference pair: Logical–Empathetic and Reasonable–Compassionate.
Your style is Logical and Reasonable.  This style means that you likely
• Trust the Thinking preference and readily make decisions based on logical analysis of data.
• Recognize the impact of your decisions on people and relationships but see that as secondary.
• Focus on accuracy to achieve a good decision.
• Are seen as precise, objective, and confident.
• Are sometimes seen as inflexible.
In individual problem solving, start by asking all  the questions in the 
chart above.
•  Pay careful attention to the answers. The questions that are 
opposite to the ones in blue italics  may be key since they 
represent perspectives you aren’t likely to consider. 
• Try to balance your decision-making style by considering the 
less preferred parts of your personality.In group problem solving, actively seek out people with different 
views. Ask for their concerns and perspectives. 
• Do a final check to make sure that all the questions above 
have been asked and that different decision-making styles are 
included. 
• If you are missing a perspective, make extra efforts to consider 
what it might add.TIPS

Applying Step II™ Results to Managing Change
Change seems to be inevitable and affects people in different ways. To help you deal with change,
•  Be clear about what is changing and what is remaining the same.
• Identify what you need to know to understand the change and then seek out that information.
To help others deal with change,
•  Encourage open discussion about the change; be aware that this is easier for some than for others. 
• Make sure that both logical reasons and personal or social values have been considered.
Your personality type also influences your style of managing change, particularly your results on the nine facets below. 
Review the facets and tips for enhancing your response to change.
YOUR FACET RESULT CHANGE MANAGEMENT STYLE ENHANCING YOUR STYLE
Expressive Freely share your feelings about the change 
with others.Limit your expressiveness to those who 
appreciate your style; give others time to think 
things through.
Gregarious Discuss the changes and their impact on you 
with the broadest range of people.Be aware that people vary in their level of 
interest in what you have to say and thus be 
selective in whom you talk to.
Concrete May get stuck on some aspects of change and 
ignore others.Ask someone to help you move from the facts 
and details to reasonable possibilities.
Realistic Focus on the commonsense aspects of  
the change.Realize that commonsense outcomes may not 
be immediately apparent.
Experiential Want to see an example of how the change  
will work.Accept that the impact of some changes can’t 
be demonstrated in advance.
Traditional–Original
midzoneWant to keep the best of the established 
methods but are willing to change others.Let others know the reasons for your views to 
help them understand your perspective.
Tough Will actively embrace or resist change, 
depending on whether you agree with it.Step back and consider whether your stance will 
really get you what you want in the long run.
Planful Plan as far in advance as possible for the 
changes.Allow for the unexpected in your long-range 
plan—it will happen!
Methodical Detail the many steps necessary to implement 
the changes.Know that circumstances may require carefully 
developed steps to be changed in the moment.

Applying Step II™ Results to Managing Conflict
Conflicts are inevitable when working with others. People of distinct personality types may differ in what they define as 
conflict, how they react to it, and how they reach resolution. Although sometimes unpleasant, conflicts often lead to 
improved work situations and enhanced relationships.
Part of conflict management for every type includes
• Taking care of getting the work done while maintaining your relationships with the people involved.
• Recognizing that all perspectives have something to add, but any perspective used in its extreme and to the exclusion 
of its opposite will ultimately impede conflict resolution.
The table below explains how your results on six Step II facets may affect your efforts to manage conflict.
YOUR FACET RESULT CONFLICT MANAGEMENT STYLE ENHANCING YOUR STYLE
Expressive Discuss the conflict and your emotional 
reactions to it immediately.Be aware that even though others may not 
speak up immediately, they may feel strongly 
about the issue.
Gregarious Involve all relevant people in resolving the 
conflict, not just those you know well.Respect the need of some people to remain 
uninvolved until they are ready to participate.
Accommodating Try to create harmony by accommodating 
different views.Let people know when an issue is really 
important to you and what you want; you may 
be giving in too often.
Critical Point out what is still wrong and needs 
correcting.Realize that your style may upset others and try 
to pull back and be more accepting.
Tough Push to resolve the conflict immediately so 
that progress can be made.Recognize that delays in implementation may 
be necessary to reach the goal.
Early Starting Believe conflicts can be avoided by starting 
work on projects early.Make allowances for people for whom starting 
early isn’t comfortable or effective.
In addition to your facet results, your decision-making style (as explained earlier) affects how you manage conflict. Your 
decision-making style is Logical and Reasonable. You are likely to focus on the logic of the situation, thinking that others 
see it the same way. To make your efforts to manage conflict more effective, keep in mind that not all situations are win-
lose, and resist taking a competitive stance.

How the Parts of Your Personality Work Together
The essence of type involves the way people take in information (Sensing or Intuition) and how they make decisions  
(Thinking or Feeling). Each type has a favorite way of doing those two things. The two middle letters of your  
four-letter type (S or N and T or F) show your favorite processes. Their opposites, whose letters don’t appear in your  
four-letter type, are third and fourth in importance for your type. Remember—you use all parts of your personality  
at least some of the time. 
Using Your Favorite Processes
People who prefer Extraversion like to use their favorite process mostly in the outer world of people and things. For 
balance, they use their second process in their inner world of ideas and impressions. People who prefer Introversion tend 
to use their favorite process mostly in their inner world and to balance this with the use of their second process in the 
outer world.
Thus ESTJs use
•  Thinking mainly externally (Te) to communicate their analyses and logical decisions to others.
• Sensing mainly internally (Si) to consider the facts and details they have found.
Using Your Less Favored Processes
When you frequently use the less preferred parts of your personality, Intuition and Feeling, remember that you are 
working outside your natural comfort zone. You may feel awkward, tired, or frustrated at these times. As an ESTJ,  
you may become overly controlling and critical at first and then feel unappreciated, emotionally vulnerable, and 
despairing.
To bring back some balance, try the following:
•  Take more breaks in your activities when you are using these less familiar parts of your personality— 
Intuition and Feeling.
• Make an effort to find time to do something enjoyable that involves using your favorite processes— 
Thinking and Sensing.FEELING   41   THINKING

Using Your Type Effectively
ESTJs’ preference for Thinking and Sensing makes them mostly interested in
•  Reaching logical conclusions about facts and experiences.
• Acquiring and using facts and experiences.
They typically devote little energy to the less preferred parts of their personality, Feeling and Intuition. These parts may 
remain inexperienced and be less available for use in situations where they might be helpful.
As an ESTJ,
• If you rely too much on your Thinking, you may neglect to compliment people when you should and fail to notice 
the impact of your decisions on others.
• If you pay attention exclusively to your Sensing, you are likely to miss the big picture, other meanings of the 
information, and new possibilities.
Your personality type is likely to develop in a natural way over your lifetime. As people get older, many become interested 
in using the less familiar parts of their personality. When they are in midlife or older, ESTJs often find themselves devoting 
more time to things that were not very appealing when they were younger. For example, they report greater pleasure in 
personal relationships and in considering new ways of doing things.
How the Facets Can Help You Be More Effective
Sometimes a particular situation calls for using a less preferred part of your personality. Your facet results can make it 
easier for you to temporarily adopt a less natural approach. Begin by identifying which facets are relevant and which poles 
are more appropriate to use.
• If you are out-of-preference  on one or more of the relevant facets, make sure to focus on using approaches and 
behaviors related to those out-of-preference facets. 
• If you are in the midzone,  decide which pole is more appropriate for the situation at hand and make sure you use 
approaches and behaviors related to that pole.
• If you are in-preference,  ask someone at the opposite facet pole for help in using that approach or read a description 
of that pole to get clues for modifying your behavior. Once you have a good approach, resist shifting back into your 
comfort zone.
Here are two examples of how to apply these suggestions.
• If you are in a situation where your natural way of taking in information (Sensing) may not be appropriate, try to 
modify your Concrete approach (an in-preference result) by considering the meanings and implications of your 
factual information (Abstract).
• If you are in a situation where you might need to adapt your way of getting things done (Judging), try to modify your 
Scheduled approach to accomplishing tasks (an in-preference result) by asking yourself if staying open to unexpected 
events (Spontaneous) might lead to better results in this particular situation.

YOUR STEP II™  
INDIVIDUALIZED TYPE
Integrating Step I™ and Step II™ Information
When you combine your Step I reported type and your Step II out-of-
preference facets, the result is your Step II individualized type, shown on  
the left.
If, after reading all the information in this report, you don’t think you have 
been accurately described, perhaps a different four-letter type or some 
variation on the facets will fit you better. 
To help you figure out your best-fit type,
• Focus on any type letters you thought were incorrect or any preference 
pairs on which you had some out-of-preference or midzone facet results.
• Read the type description for the type you would be if the letter or letters 
you question were the opposite preference. 
• Consult your MBTI interpreter for suggestions.
• Observe yourself and ask others how they see you.
Using Type to Gain Understanding
Knowledge of type can enrich your life in several ways. It can help you
• Better understand yourself.  Knowing your own type helps you understand 
the assets and liabilities of your typical reactions. 
• Understand others.  Knowing about type helps you recognize that other 
people may be different. It can enable you to see those differences as 
useful and broadening, rather than annoying and restricting.
• Gain perspective.  Seeing yourself and others in the context of type can 
help you appreciate the legitimacy of other points of view. You can then 
avoid getting stuck in believing your way is the only way. No perspective 
is always right or always wrong.
Reading about type and observing yourself and others from the standpoint of 
type will enrich your understanding of personality differences and encourage 
constructive use of those differences.

Overvie w of Y our Results
Your Four-Letter Type from the Step I™ Assessment  
ESTJs tend to be logical, practical, realistic, matter-of-fact, and efficient. They like to organize themselves and others. 
They follow through and expect others to be dependable also. They run activities but focus more on tasks than on 
people. ESTJs are not interested in things for which they see little use.

Polarity Index: 71
The polarity index, which ranges from 0 to 100, shows the consistency of a respondent’s facet scores within a profile. Most adults 
score between 50 and 65, although higher indexes are common. An index that is below 45 means that the respondent has many 
scores in or near the midzone. This may be due to mature situational use of the facet, answering the questions randomly, lack of 
self-knowledge, or ambivalence about use of a facet. Some such profiles may be invalid.
